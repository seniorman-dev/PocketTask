*Choose state management
-I used GetX for effective state management

*Software Architective
- In the project, the Model-View-Controller (M.V.C) architecture was utilized.
  This architecture in Flutter provides a structured approach to the application development by separating the application into three distinct layers: the "Model", which handles data and business logic, the "View", which manages the user interface and presentation and the "Controller", which acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View, handling user input and updating the UI accordingly. When combined with GetX for state management, this architecture becomes even more efficient and reactive. GetX simplifies the Controllerâ€™s responsibilities by offering built-in support for dependency injection, reactive programming, and minimal boilerplate. It enables the UI (View) to automatically respond to changes in the data (Model) without manual state management. This seamless flow enhances maintainability, testability, and overall code organization, making MVC with GetX a powerful pattern for scalable Flutter development.
